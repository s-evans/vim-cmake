<PROJECT-NAME>_BINARY_DIR                *<PROJECT-NAME>_BINARY_DIR*
-------------------------

Top level binary directory for the named project.

A variable is created with the name used in the ``project()`` command,

CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES   *CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES* *_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES*
--------------------------------------

Implicit linker search path detected for language <LANG>.

Compilers typically pass directories containing language runtime
libraries and default library search paths when they invoke a linker.
These paths are implicit linker search directories for the compiler's
language.  CMake automatically detects these directories for each
language and reports the results in this variable.

When a library in one of these directories is given by full path to
|target_link_libraries|() CMake will generate the -l<name> form on link
lines to ensure the linker searches its implicit directories for the
library.  Note that some toolchains read implicit directories from an
environment variable such as LIBRARY_PATH so keep its value consistent
when operating in a given build tree.

CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE           *CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE* *_LINKER_PREFERENCE*
------------------------------

Preference value for linker language selection.

The "linker language" for executable, shared library, and module
targets is the language whose compiler will invoke the linker.  The
|LINKER_LANGUAGE| target property sets the language explicitly.
Otherwise, the linker language is that whose linker preference value
is highest among languages compiled and linked into the target.  See
also the |CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES| variable.

command line argument.  It then also sets CMAKE_ARGV1, CMAKE_ARGV2,
...  and so on, up to the number of command line arguments given.  See
also |CMAKE_ARGC|.

CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE               *CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE*
--------------------------

Switch between strict and relaxed automoc mode.

By default, ``|AUTOMOC|`` behaves exactly as described in the documentation
of the ``|AUTOMOC|`` target property.  When set to ``TRUE``, it accepts more
input and tries to find the correct input file for ``moc`` even if it
differs from the documented behaviour.  In this mode it e.g.  also
checks whether a header file is intended to be processed by moc when a
``"foo.moc"`` file has been included.

Relaxed mode has to be enabled for KDE4 compatibility.

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE                         *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE*
----------------

Specifies the build type on single-configuration generators.

This statically specifies what build type (configuration) will be
built in this build tree.  Possible values are empty, Debug, Release,
RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel.  This variable is only meaningful to
single-configuration generators (such as make and Ninja) i.e.  those
which choose a single configuration when CMake runs to generate a
build tree as opposed to multi-configuration generators which offer
selection of the build configuration within the generated build
environment.  There are many per-config properties and variables
(usually following clean SOME_VAR_<CONFIG> order conventions), such as
CMAKE_C_FLAGS_<CONFIG>, specified as uppercase:
CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[DEBUG|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO|MINSIZEREL].  For example,
in a build tree configured to build type Debug, CMake will see to
having CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG settings get added to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS
settings.  See also |CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES|.

CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH           *CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH*
------------------------------

Use the install path for the RPATH

Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
install RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
always built with the install path for the RPATH and does not need to
be relinked when installed.

CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION                *CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION*
-------------------------

Major version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

This stores the major version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
on a previously created cache file.

Minor version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

This stores the minor version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
on a previously created cache file.

CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION                *CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION*
-------------------------

Patch version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

This stores the patch version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
on a previously created cache file.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR                         *CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR*
----------------

Build-time reference to per-configuration output subdirectory.

For native build systems supporting multiple configurations in the
build tree (such as Visual Studio and Xcode), the value is a reference
to a build-time variable specifying the name of the per-configuration
output subdirectory.  On Makefile generators this evaluates to "."
because there is only one configuration in a build tree.  Example
values:

::

 $(IntDir)            = Visual Studio 6
 $(ConfigurationName) = Visual Studio 7, 8, 9
 $(Configuration)     = Visual Studio 10
 $(CONFIGURATION)     = Xcode
 .                    = Make-based tools

Since these values are evaluated by the native build system, this
variable is suitable only for use in command lines that will be
evaluated at build time.  Example of intended usage:

::

 |add_executable|(mytool mytool.c)
 |add_custom_command|(
   OUTPUT out.txt
   COMMAND ${|CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR|}/${|CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR|}/mytool
           ${|CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR|}/in.txt out.txt
   |DEPENDS| mytool in.txt
   )
 |add_custom_target|(drive ALL |DEPENDS| out.txt)

Note that |CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR| is no longer necessary for this purpose but
has been left for compatibility with existing projects.  Instead
|add_custom_command|() recognizes executable target names in its COMMAND
option, so "${|CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR|}/${|CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR|}/mytool"
can be replaced by just "mytool".

This variable is read-only.  Setting it is undefined behavior.  In
multi-configuration build systems the value of this variable is passed
as the value of preprocessor symbol "CMAKE_INTDIR" to the compilation
of all source files.

If the selected <LANG> compiler is the GNU compiler then this is TRUE,
if not it is FALSE.  Unlike the other per-language variables, this
uses the GNU syntax for identifying languages instead of the CMake
syntax.  Recognized values of the <LANG> suffix are:

CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES                *CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES*
-------------------------

Specifies the available build types on multi-config generators.

This specifies what build types (configurations) will be available
such as Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo etc.  This has reasonable
defaults on most platforms, but can be extended to provide other build
types.  See also |CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE| for details of managing
configuration data, and |CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR|.

This variable is only used when ``|CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING|`` is on. It
should point to a command on the host system that can run executable built
for the target system.

The command will be used to run ``|try_run|()`` generated executables,
which avoids manual population of the TryRunResults.cmake file.

It is also used as the default value for the
``|CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR|`` target property of executables.

------------------------

The path to the binary directory currently being processed.

This the full path to the build directory that is currently being
processed by cmake.  Each directory added by |add_subdirectory| will
create a binary directory in the build tree, and as it is being
processed this variable will be set.  For in-source builds this is the
current source directory being processed.

CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR                   *CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR*
----------------------

Full directory of the listfile currently being processed.

As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will
always be set to the directory where the listfile which is currently
being processed (|CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE|) is located.  The value has
dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file
it sets this variable to the directory where this file is located.
When CMake finishes processing commands from the file it restores the
previous value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or
function is the directory of the file invoking the bottom-most entry
on the call stack, not the directory of the file containing the macro
or function definition.

setting the variable |CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>| to TRUE.
This can be used to build a project without an optional package,
although that package is installed.

This switch should be used during the initial CMake run.  Otherwise if
the package has already been found in a previous CMake run, the

that case it is recommended to remove the cache variables for this
package from the cache using the cache editor or cmake -U

CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY         *CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY*
--------------------------------

Disable the ``export(PACKAGE)`` command.

In some cases, for example for packaging and for system wide
installations, it is not desirable to write the user package registry.
If the ``|CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY|`` variable is enabled,
the ``export(PACKAGE)`` command will do nothing.

CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR                    *CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR*
---------------------

The extra generator used to build the project.

When using the Eclipse, CodeBlocks or KDevelop generators, CMake
generates Makefiles (|CMAKE_GENERATOR|) and additionally project files
for the respective IDE.  This IDE project file generator is stored in
|CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR| (e.g.  "Eclipse CDT4").

CMAKE_EXTRA_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES      *CMAKE_EXTRA_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES*
-----------------------------------

Additional suffixes for shared libraries.

Extensions for shared libraries other than that specified by
|CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX|, if any.  CMake uses this to recognize
external shared library files during analysis of libraries linked by a
target.

CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES              *CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES*
---------------------------

Prefixes to prepend when looking for libraries.

This specifies what prefixes to add to library names when the
|find_library| command looks for libraries.  On |UNIX| systems this is
typically lib, meaning that when trying to find the foo library it
will look for libfoo.

CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES              *CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES*
---------------------------

Suffixes to append when looking for libraries.

This specifies what suffixes to add to library names when the
|find_library| command looks for libraries.  On Windows systems this is
typically .lib and .dll, meaning that when trying to find the foo
library it will look for foo.dll etc.

CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX             *CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX*
----------------------------

Ignore the ``|CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX|`` when searching for assets.

CMake adds the ``|CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX|`` and the
``|CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX|`` variable to the
``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH|`` by default. This variable may be set
on the command line to control that behavior.

Set ``|CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX|`` to TRUE to tell |find_package| not
to search in the ``|CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX|`` or
``|CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX|`` by default.  Note that the
prefix may still be searched for other reasons, such as being the same prefix
as the CMake installation, or for being a built-in system prefix.

CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY   *CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY*
--------------------------------------

Skip :ref:`User Package Registry` in ``|find_package|()`` calls.

In some cases, for example to locate only system wide installations, it
is not desirable to use the :ref:`User Package Registry` when searching
for packages. If the ``|CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY|``
variable is enabled, all the ``|find_package|()`` commands will skip
the :ref:`User Package Registry` as if they were called with the
``NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` argument.

See also :ref:`Disabling the Package Registry`.

CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY *CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY*
---------------------------------------------

Skip :ref:`System Package Registry` in ``|find_package|()`` calls.

In some cases, it is not desirable to use the
:ref:`System Package Registry` when searching for packages. If the
``|CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY|`` variable is
enabled, all the ``|find_package|()`` commands will skip
the :ref:`System Package Registry` as if they were called with the
``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` argument.

CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE        *CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE*
---------------------------------

Tell |find_package| to warn if called without an explicit mode.

If |find_package| is called without an explicit mode option (MODULE,
CONFIG or NO_MODULE) and no Find<pkg>.cmake module is in
|CMAKE_MODULE_PATH| then CMake implicitly assumes that the caller
intends to search for a package configuration file.  If no package
configuration file is found then the wording of the failure message
must account for both the case that the package is really missing and
the case that the project has a bug and failed to provide the intended
Find module.  If instead the caller specifies an explicit mode option
then the failure message can be more specific.

Set |CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE| to TRUE to tell |find_package| to
warn when it implicitly assumes Config mode.  This helps developers
enforce use of an explicit mode in all calls to |find_package| within a
project.

CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH                     *CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH*
--------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of root paths to search on the filesystem.

This variable is most useful when cross-compiling. CMake uses the paths in
this list as alternative roots to find filesystem items with ``|find_package|()``,
``|find_library|()`` etc.

If set to ``ONLY``, then only the roots in ``|CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH|``
will be searched. If set to ``NEVER``, then the roots in
``|CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH|`` will be ignored and only the host system
root will be used. If set to ``BOTH``, then the host system paths and the

Some CMake generators support a target platform name to be given
to the native build system to choose a compiler toolchain.
If the user specifies a platform name (e.g. via the cmake -A option)
the value will be available in this variable.

The value of this variable should never be modified by project code.

environments where some system directories contain incompatible but
possibly linkable libraries.  For example, on cross-compiled cluster
environments, this allows a user to ignore directories containing
libraries meant for the front-end machine.

By default this is empty; it is intended to be set by the project.

If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds in each
directory ${|CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR|} and ${|CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR|}
to the include path for this directory.  These additional include
directories do not propagate down to subdirectories.  This is useful
mainly for out-of-source builds, where files generated into the build

For paths that are newly installed or updated, installation
may print lines like::

 -- Installing: /some/destination/path

For paths that are already up to date, installation may print
lines like::

 -- Up-to-date: /some/destination/path

The ``|CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE|`` variable may be set to control
which messages are printed:

``ALWAYS``
  Print both ``Installing`` and ``Up-to-date`` messages.

``LAZY``
  Print ``Installing`` but not ``Up-to-date`` messages.

``NEVER``
  Print neither ``Installing`` nor ``Up-to-date`` messages.

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX                     *CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX*
--------------------

Install directory used by install.

If "make install" is invoked or INSTALL is built, this directory is
prepended onto all install directories.  This variable defaults to
/usr/local on |UNIX| and c:/Program Files on Windows.

On |UNIX| one can use the DESTDIR mechanism in order to relocate the
whole installation.  DESTDIR means DESTination DIRectory.  It is
commonly used by makefile users in order to install software at
non-default location.  It is usually invoked like this:

::

 make DESTDIR=/home/john install

which will install the concerned software using the installation
prefix, e.g.  "/usr/local" prepended with the DESTDIR value which
finally gives "/home/john/usr/local".

WARNING: DESTDIR may not be used on Windows because installation
prefix usually contains a drive letter like in "C:/Program Files"
which cannot be prepended with some other prefix.

The installation prefix is also added to |CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH| so
that |find_package|, |find_program|, |find_library|, |find_path|, and
|find_file| will search the prefix for other software.

.. note::

  Use the ``|GNUInstallDirs|`` module to provide GNU-style
  options for the layout of directories within the installation.

Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

|CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH| is a boolean that if set to true
will append directories in the linker search path and outside the
project to the |INSTALL_RPATH|.  This is used to initialize the target
property |INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH| for all targets.

CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION                      *CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION*
-------------------

First version number component of the ``|CMAKE_VERSION|``
variable.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM                       *CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM*
------------------

Tool that can launch the native build system.
The value may be the full path to an executable or just the tool
name if it is expected to be in the ``PATH``.

The tool selected depends on the ``|CMAKE_GENERATOR|`` used
to configure the project:

* The Makefile generators set this to ``make``, ``gmake``, or
  a generator-specific tool (e.g. ``nmake`` for "NMake Makefiles").

  These generators store ``|CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM|`` in the CMake cache
  so that it may be edited by the user.

* The Ninja generator sets this to ``ninja``.

  This generator stores ``|CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM|`` in the CMake cache
  so that it may be edited by the user.

* The Xcode generator sets this to ``xcodebuild`` (or possibly an
  otherwise undocumented ``cmakexbuild`` wrapper implementing some
  workarounds).

  This generator prefers to lookup the build tool at build time
  rather than to store ``|CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM|`` in the CMake cache
  ahead of time.  This is because ``xcodebuild`` is easy to find,
  the ``cmakexbuild`` wrapper is needed only for older Xcode versions,
  and the path to ``cmakexbuild`` may be outdated if CMake itself moves.

  For compatibility with versions of CMake prior to 3.2, if
  a user or project explicitly adds ``|CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM|`` to
  the CMake cache then CMake will use the specified value.

* The Visual Studio generators set this to the full path to
  ``MSBuild.exe`` (VS >= 10), ``devenv.com`` (VS 7,8,9),
  ``VCExpress.exe`` (VS Express 8,9), or ``msdev.exe`` (VS 6).
  (See also variables
  ``|CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND|``,
  ``|CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND|``, and
  ``|CMAKE_VS_MSDEV_COMMAND|``.)

  These generators prefer to lookup the build tool at build time
  rather than to store ``|CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM|`` in the CMake cache
  ahead of time.  This is because the tools are version-specific
  and can be located using the Windows Registry.  It is also
  necessary because the proper build tool may depend on the
  project content (e.g. the Intel Fortran plugin to VS 10 and 11
  requires ``devenv.com`` to build its ``.vfproj`` project files
  even though ``MSBuild.exe`` is normally preferred to support
  the ``|CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET|``).

  For compatibility with versions of CMake prior to 3.0, if
  a user or project explicitly adds ``|CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM|`` to
  the CMake cache then CMake will use the specified value if
  possible.

* The ``Green Hills MULTI`` generator sets this to ``gbuild``.
  If a user or project explicitly adds ``|CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM|`` to
  the CMake cache then CMake will use the specified value.

The ``|CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM|`` variable is set for use by project code.
The value is also used by the ``cmake(1)`` ``--build`` and
``ctest(1)`` ``--build-and-test`` tools to launch the native
build process.

property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.

CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT                        *CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT*
-----------------

The number of matches with the last regular expression.

When a regular expression match is used, CMake fills in ``CMAKE_MATCH_<n>``
variables with the match contents. The ``|CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT|`` variable holds
the number of match expressions when these are filled.

CMAKE_MFC_FLAG                           *CMAKE_MFC_FLAG*
--------------

Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable or dll.

This can be set in a CMakeLists.txt file and will enable MFC in the
application.  It should be set to 1 for the static MFC library, and 2
for the shared MFC library.  This is used in Visual Studio 6 and 7
project files.  The CMakeSetup dialog used MFC and the CMakeLists.txt
looks like this:

::

 |add_definitions|(-D_AFXDLL)
 set(|CMAKE_MFC_FLAG| 2)
 |add_executable|(CMakeSetup |WIN32| ${SRCS})

CMAKE_MODULE_PATH                        *CMAKE_MODULE_PATH*
-----------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for CMake modules to be loaded by the the ``include()`` or
``|find_package|()`` commands before checking the default modules that come
with CMake.  By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project.

CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH                 *CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH*
------------------------

Do not use the builtin ELF editor to fix RPATHs on installation.

When an ELF binary needs to have a different RPATH after installation
than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a builtin editor to change
the RPATH in the installed copy.  If this variable is set to true then
CMake will relink the binary before installation instead of using its
builtin editor.

CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX                    *CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX*
---------------------

Maximum object file full-path length allowed by native build tools.

CMake computes for every source file an object file name that is
unique to the source file and deterministic with respect to the full
path to the source file.  This allows multiple source files in a
target to share the same name if they lie in different directories
without rebuilding when one is added or removed.  However, it can
produce long full paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path
using a hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds a
limit.  CMake has a built-in limit for each platform that is
sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may have a lower
limit.  This variable may be set to specify the limit explicitly.  The
value must be an integer no less than 128.

CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES                  *CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES*
-----------------------

Target specific architectures for OS X.

This variable is used to initialize the ``|OSX_ARCHITECTURES|``
property on each target as it is creaed.  See that target property
for additional information.

The value of this variable should be set prior to the first
``project()`` or ``|enable_language|()`` command invocation
because it may influence configuration of the toolchain and flags.
It is intended to be set locally by the user creating a build tree.

This variable is ignored on platforms other than OS X.

CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET              *CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET*
---------------------------

Specify the minimum version of OS X on which the target binaries are
to be deployed.  CMake uses this value for the ``-mmacosx-version-min``
flag and to help choose the default SDK
(see ``|CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT|``).

If not set explicitly the value is initialized by the
``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` environment variable, if set,
and otherwise computed based on the host platform.

The value of this variable should be set prior to the first
``project()`` or ``|enable_language|()`` command invocation
because it may influence configuration of the toolchain and flags.
It is intended to be set locally by the user creating a build tree.

This variable is ignored on platforms other than OS X.

CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT                        *CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT*
-----------------

Specify the location or name of the OS X platform SDK to be used.
CMake uses this value to compute the value of the ``-isysroot`` flag
or equivalent and to help the ``find_*`` commands locate files in
the SDK.

If not set explicitly the value is initialized by the ``SDKROOT``
environment variable, if set, and otherwise computed based on the
``|CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET|`` or the host platform.

The value of this variable should be set prior to the first
``project()`` or ``|enable_language|()`` command invocation
because it may influence configuration of the toolchain and flags.
It is intended to be set locally by the user creating a build tree.

This variable is ignored on platforms other than OS X.

CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE                   *CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE*
----------------------

Full path to the CMake file that included the current one.

While processing a CMake file loaded by include() or |find_package|()
this variable contains the full path to the file including it.  The
top of the include stack is always the CMakeLists.txt for the current
directory.  See also |CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE|.

CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>           *CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>*
------------------------------

Default for CMake Policy CMP<NNNN> when it is otherwise left unset.

Commands |cmake_minimum_required|(VERSION) and |cmake_policy|(VERSION) by
default leave policies introduced after the given version unset.  Set
|CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>| to OLD or NEW to specify the default
for policy CMP<NNNN>, where <NNNN> is the policy number.

This variable should not be set by a project in CMake code; use
|cmake_policy|(SET) instead.  Users running CMake may set this variable
in the cache (e.g.  -DCMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>=<OLD|NEW>) to set
a policy not otherwise set by the project.  Set to OLD to quiet a
policy warning while using old behavior or to NEW to try building the
project with new behavior.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>           *CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>*
------------------------------

Explicitly enable or disable the warning when CMake Policy ``CMP<NNNN>``
is not set.  This is meaningful only for the few policies that do not
warn by default:

* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0025`` controls the warning for
  policy ``CMP0025``.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0047`` controls the warning for
  policy ``CMP0047``.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0056`` controls the warning for
  policy ``CMP0056``.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0060`` controls the warning for
  policy ``CMP0060``.

This variable should not be set by a project in CMake code.  Project
developers running CMake may set this variable in their cache to
enable the warning (e.g. ``-DCMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>=ON``).
Alternatively, running ``cmake(1)`` with the ``--debug-output``
or ``--trace`` option will also enable the warning.

The suffix to use for the end of a shared library filename, .dll on
Windows.

CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|

CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS                *CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS*
-------------------------

Linker flags to be used to create shared libraries.

These flags will be used by the linker when creating a shared library.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>       *CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>*
----------------------------------

Flags to be used when linking a shared library.

Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when creating shared
libraries.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX               *CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX*
--------------------------

The prefix for loadable modules that you link to.

The prefix to use for the name of a loadable module on this platform.

CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX               *CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX*
--------------------------

The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.

The suffix to use for the end of a loadable module filename on this
platform

CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P                      *CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P*
-------------------

Size of a void pointer.

This is set to the size of a pointer on the target machine, and is determined
by a try compile.  If a 64 bit size is found, then the library search
path is modified to look for 64 bit libraries first.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH                   *CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH*
----------------------

Do not include RPATHs in the build tree.

Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
install RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
always built with no RPATH.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY        *CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY*
---------------------------------

Don't make the install target depend on the all target.

By default, the "install" target depends on the "all" target.  This
has the effect, that when "make install" is invoked or INSTALL is
built, first the "all" target is built, then the installation starts.
If |CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY| is set to TRUE, this dependency
is not created, so the installation process will start immediately,
independent from whether the project has been completely built or not.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH                 *CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH*
------------------------

Do not include RPATHs in the install tree.

Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
install RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
always installed without RPATH, even if RPATH is enabled when
building.  This can be useful for example to allow running tests from
the build directory with RPATH enabled before the installation step.
To omit RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
|CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH| instead.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RULES                 *CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RULES*
------------------------

Whether to disable generation of installation rules.

If TRUE, cmake will neither generate installaton rules nor
will it generate cmake_install.cmake files. This variable is FALSE by default.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH                         *CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH*
----------------

If true, do not add run time path information.

If this is set to TRUE, then the rpath information is not added to
compiled executables.  The default is to add rpath information if the
platform supports it.  This allows for easy running from the build
tree.  To omit RPATH in the install step, but not the build step, use
|CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH| instead.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR                         *CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR*
----------------

The path to the top level of the source tree.

This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake source
tree.  For an in-source build, this would be the same as
|CMAKE_BINARY_DIR|.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX                     *CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX*
--------------------

This variable may be set to a path to install to when cross-compiling. This can
be useful if the path in ``|CMAKE_SYSROOT|`` is read-only, or otherwise
should remain pristine.

The |CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX| location is also used as a search prefix by the ``find_*``
commands. This can be controlled by setting the ``|CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX|``
variable.

If any RPATH/RUNPATH entries passed to the linker contain the |CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX|,
the matching path fragments are replaced with the ``|CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX|``.

CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX              *CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX*
---------------------------

The prefix for static libraries that you link to.

The prefix to use for the name of a static library, lib on |UNIX|.

CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX_<LANG> overrides this for language <LANG>.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX              *CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX*

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>       *CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>*
----------------------------------

Flags to be used when linking a static library.

Same as CMAKE_C_FLAGS_* but used by the linker when creating static
libraries.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SYSROOT                            *CMAKE_SYSROOT*
-------------

Path to pass to the compiler in the ``--sysroot`` flag.

The ``|CMAKE_SYSROOT|`` content is passed to the compiler in the ``--sysroot``
flag, if supported.  The path is also stripped from the RPATH/RUNPATH if
necessary on installation.  The ``|CMAKE_SYSROOT|`` is also used to prefix
paths searched by the ``find_*`` commands.

This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by
the ``|CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE|`` variable.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SYSTEM                             *CMAKE_SYSTEM*
------------

Composit Name of OS CMake is compiling for.

This variable is the composite of ``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME|`` and
``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION|``, e.g.
``${|CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME|}-${|CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION|}``.  If
``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION|`` is not set, then this variable is
the same as ``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME|``.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH                 *CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH*
------------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories to be *ignored* by
the ``|find_program|()``, ``|find_library|()``, ``|find_file|()``,
and ``|find_path|()`` commands.  This is useful in cross-compiling
environments where some system directories contain incompatible but
possibly linkable libraries.  For example, on cross-compiled cluster
environments, this allows a user to ignore directories containing
libraries meant for the front-end machine.

By default this contains a list of directories containing incompatible
binaries for the host system.  See the ``|CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH|`` variable
that is intended to be set by the project.

See also the ``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH|``,
``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH|``, ``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH|``,
and ``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH|`` variables.

CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH                *CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH*
-------------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the ``|find_file|()`` and ``|find_path|()`` commands.  By default
this contains the standard directories for the current system.  It is *not*
intended to be modified by the project; use ``|CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH|`` for
this.  See also ``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH|``.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH                *CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH*
-------------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the ``|find_library|()`` command.  By default this contains the
standard directories for the current system.  It is *not* intended to be
modified by the project; use ``|CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH|`` for this.
See also ``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH|``.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME                        *CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME*
-----------------

Name of the OS CMake is building for.

This is the name of the OS on which CMake is targeting.  This variable
is the same as ``|CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME|`` if you build for the
host system instead of the target system when cross compiling.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH                 *CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH*
------------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying installation
*prefixes* to be searched by the ``|find_package|()``,
``|find_program|()``, ``|find_library|()``, ``|find_file|()``, and
``|find_path|()`` commands.  Each command will add appropriate
subdirectories (like ``bin``, ``lib``, or ``include``) as specified in its own
documentation.

By default this contains the standard directories for the current system, the
``|CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX|``, and the ``|CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX|``.
It is *not* intended to be modified by the project; use
``|CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH|`` for this.

See also ``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH|``,
``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH|``, ``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH|``,
and ``|CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH|``.

CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR                   *CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR*
----------------------

The name of the CPU CMake is building for.

This variable is the same as ``|CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR|`` if
you build for the host system instead of the target system when
cross compiling.

* The Green Hills MULTI generator sets this to ``ARM`` by default

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH                *CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH*
-------------------------

:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the ``|find_program|()`` command.  By default this contains the
standard directories for the current system.  It is *not* intended to be
modified by the project; use ``|CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH|`` for this.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE                     *CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE*
--------------------

Path to toolchain file supplied to ``cmake(1)``.

This variable is specified on the command line when cross-compiling with CMake.
It is the path to a file which is read early in the CMake run and which specifies
locations for compilers and toolchain utilities, and other target platform and
compiler related information.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION          *CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION*
-------------------------------

Build configuration used for |try_compile| and |try_run| projects.

Projects built by |try_compile| and |try_run| are built synchronously
during the CMake configuration step.  Therefore a specific build
configuration must be chosen even if the generated build system
supports multiple configurations.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION                      *CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION*
-------------------

Defined to ``0`` for compatibility with code written for older
CMake versions that may have defined higher values.

.. note::

  In CMake versions 2.8.2 through 2.8.12, this variable holds
  the fourth version number component of the
  ``|CMAKE_VERSION|`` variable.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE           *CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE*
------------------------------

Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information.

CMake loads the specified file while enabling support for each
language from either the project() or |enable_language|() commands.  It
is loaded after CMake's builtin compiler and platform information
modules have been loaded but before the information is used.  The file
may set platform information variables to override CMake's defaults.

This feature is intended for use only in overriding information
variables that must be set before CMake builds its first test project
to check that the compiler for a language works.  It should not be
used to load a file in cases that a normal include() will work.  Use
it only as a last resort for behavior that cannot be achieved any
other way.  For example, one may set CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT to change the
default value used to initialize CMAKE_C_FLAGS before it is cached.
The override file should NOT be used to set anything that could be set
after languages are enabled, such as variables like
|CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY| that affect the placement of binaries.
Information set in the file will be used for |try_compile| and |try_run|
builds too.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_<LANG>    *CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_<LANG>*
-------------------------------------

Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information for <LANG>.

This is a language-specific version of |CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE|
loaded only when enabling language <LANG>.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS                 *CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS*
------------------------

Use relative paths (May not work!).

If this is set to TRUE, then CMake will use relative paths between the
source and binary tree.  This option does not work for more
complicated projects, and relative paths are used when possible.  In
general, it is not possible to move CMake generated makefiles to a
different location regardless of the value of this variable.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE                   *CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE*
----------------------

Enable verbose output from Makefile builds.

This variable is a cache entry initialized (to FALSE) by
the ``project()`` command.  Users may enable the option
in their local build tree to get more verbose output from
Makefile builds and show each command line as it is launched.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_VERSION                            *CMAKE_VERSION*
-------------

The CMake version string as three non-negative integer components
separated by ``.`` and possibly followed by ``-`` and other information.
The first two components represent the feature level and the third
component represents either a bug-fix level or development date.

Release versions and release candidate versions of CMake use the format::

 <major>.<minor>.<patch>[-rc<n>]

where the ``<patch>`` component is less than ``20000000``.  Development
versions of CMake use the format::

 <major>.<minor>.<date>[-<id>]

where the ``<date>`` component is of format ``CCYYMMDD`` and ``<id>``
may contain arbitrary text.  This represents development as of a
particular date following the ``<major>.<minor>`` feature release.

Individual component values are also available in variables:

* ``|CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION|``
* ``|CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION|``
* ``|CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION|``
* ``|CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION|``

Use the ``if()`` command ``VERSION_LESS``, ``VERSION_EQUAL``, or
``VERSION_GREATER`` operators to compare version string values against
``|CMAKE_VERSION|`` using a component-wise test.  Version component
values may be 10 or larger so do not attempt to compare version
strings as floating-point numbers.

.. note::

  CMake versions 2.8.2 through 2.8.12 used three components for the
  feature level.  Release versions represented the bug-fix level in a
  fourth component, i.e. ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>[.<tweak>][-rc<n>]``.
  Development versions represented the development date in the fourth
  component, i.e. ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>.<date>[-<id>]``.

  CMake versions prior to 2.8.2 used three components for the
  feature level and had no bug-fix component.  Release versions
  used an even-valued second component, i.e.
  ``<major>.<even-minor>.<patch>[-rc<n>]``.  Development versions
  used an odd-valued second component with the development date as
  the third component, i.e. ``<major>.<odd-minor>.<date>``.

  The ``|CMAKE_VERSION|`` variable is defined by CMake 2.6.3 and higher.
  Earlier versions defined only the individual component variables.

CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND                  *CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND*
-----------------------

The generators for ``Visual Studio 7`` and above set this
variable to the ``devenv.com`` command installed with the corresponding
Visual Studio version.  Note that this variable may be empty on
Visual Studio Express editions because they do not provide this tool.

This variable is not defined by other generators even if ``devenv.com``
is installed on the computer.

The ``|CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND|`` is also provided for
``Visual Studio 10 2010`` and above.

CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_INSTALL_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD *CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_INSTALL_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD*
-----------------------------------------

Include INSTALL target to default build.

In Visual Studio solution, by default the INSTALL target will not be part of
the default build. Setting this variable will enable the INSTALL target to be
part of the default build.

CMAKE_VS_INTEL_Fortran_PROJECT_VERSION   *CMAKE_VS_INTEL_Fortran_PROJECT_VERSION*
--------------------------------------

When generating for Visual Studio 7 or greater with the Intel Fortran
plugin installed, this specifies the .vfproj project file format
version.  This is intended for internal use by CMake and should not be
used by project code.

     |cmake-variables| |cmake-commands| |cmake-modules| |cmake-properties|
     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND                 *CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND*
------------------------

The generators for ``Visual Studio 10 2010`` and above set this
variable to the ``MSBuild.exe`` command installed with the corresponding
Visual Studio version.

This variable is not defined by other generators even if ``MSBuild.exe``
is installed on the computer.

The ``|CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND|`` is also provided for the
non-Express editions of Visual Studio.
See also the ``|CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM|`` variable.

     |cmake-policies|



CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET                *CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET*
-------------------------

Visual Studio Platform Toolset name.

VS 10 and above use MSBuild under the hood and support multiple
compiler toolchains.  CMake may specify a toolset explicitly, such as
"v110" for VS 11 or "Windows7.1SDK" for 64-bit support in VS 10
Express.  CMake provides the name of the chosen toolset in this
variable.

CMAKE_XCODE_PLATFORM_TOOLSET             *CMAKE_XCODE_PLATFORM_TOOLSET*
----------------------------

Xcode compiler selection.

Xcode supports selection of a compiler from one of the installed
toolsets.  CMake provides the name of the chosen toolset in this
variable, if any is explicitly selected (e.g.  via the cmake -T
option).

CPACK_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES         *CPACK_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES*
--------------------------------

List of files which have been installed using  an ABSOLUTE DESTINATION path.

This variable is a Read-Only variable which is set internally by |CPack|
during installation and before packaging using
|CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES| defined in cmake_install.cmake
scripts.  The value can be used within |CPack| project configuration
file and/or CPack<GEN>.cmake file of <GEN> generator.

CPACK_COMPONENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY *CPACK_COMPONENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY*
------------------------------------------

Boolean toggle to include/exclude top level directory (component case).

Similar usage as |CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY| but for the
component case.  See |CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY| documentation
for the detail.

CPACK_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION *CPACK_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION*
-------------------------------------------

Ask |CPack| to error out as soon as a file with absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.

The fatal error is emitted before the installation of the offending
file takes place.  Some |CPack| generators, like NSIS,enforce this
internally.  This variable triggers the definition
ofCMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION when |CPack| runsVariables
common to all |CPack| generators

CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY         *CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY*
--------------------------------

Boolean toggle to include/exclude top level directory.

When preparing a package |CPack| installs the item under the so-called
top level directory.  The purpose of is to include (set to 1 or ON or
TRUE) the top level directory in the package or not (set to 0 or OFF
or FALSE).

Each |CPack| generator has a built-in default value for this variable.
E.g.  Archive generators (ZIP, TGZ, ...) includes the top level
whereas RPM or DEB don't.  The user may override the default value by
setting this variable.

There is a similar variable |CPACK_COMPONENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY|
which may be used to override the behavior for the component packaging
case which may have different default value for historical (now
backward compatibility) reason.

CPACK_INSTALL_SCRIPT                     *CPACK_INSTALL_SCRIPT*
--------------------

Extra CMake script provided by the user.

If set this CMake script will be executed by |CPack| during its local
[|CPack|-private] installation which is done right before packaging the
files.  The script is not called by e.g.: make install.

CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX           *CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX*
------------------------------

The prefix used in the built package.

Each |CPack| generator has a default value (like /usr).  This default
value may be overwritten from the CMakeLists.txt or the cpack command
line by setting an alternative value.

e.g.  set(|CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX| "/opt")

This is not the same purpose as |CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX| which is used
when installing from the build tree without building a package.

     |cmake-policies|



CPACK_SET_DESTDIR                        *CPACK_SET_DESTDIR*
-----------------

Boolean toggle to make |CPack| use DESTDIR mechanism when packaging.

DESTDIR means DESTination DIRectory.  It is commonly used by makefile
users in order to install software at non-default location.  It is a
basic relocation mechanism that should not be used on Windows (see
|CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX| documentation).  It is usually invoked like this:

::

 make DESTDIR=/home/john install

which will install the concerned software using the installation
prefix, e.g.  "/usr/local" prepended with the DESTDIR value which
finally gives "/home/john/usr/local".  When preparing a package, |CPack|
first installs the items to be packaged in a local (to the build tree)
directory by using the same DESTDIR mechanism.  Nevertheless, if
|CPACK_SET_DESTDIR| is set then |CPack| will set DESTDIR before doing the
local install.  The most noticeable difference is that without
|CPACK_SET_DESTDIR|, |CPack| uses |CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX| as a
prefix whereas with |CPACK_SET_DESTDIR| set, |CPack| will use
|CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX| as a prefix.

Manually setting |CPACK_SET_DESTDIR| may help (or simply be necessary)
if some install rules uses absolute DESTINATION (see CMake INSTALL
command).  However, starting with |CPack|/CMake 2.8.3 RPM and DEB
installers tries to handle DESTDIR automatically so that it is seldom
necessary for the user to set it.

CPACK_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION *CPACK_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION*
------------------------------------------

Ask |CPack| to warn each time a file with absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.

This variable triggers the definition of
|CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION| when |CPack| runs
cmake_install.cmake scripts.

CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND                   *CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND*
----------------------

Specify the |CTest| ``CoverageCommand`` setting
in a ``ctest(1)`` dashboard client script.

Cobertura
'''''''''

Using `Cobertura`_ as the coverage generation within your multi-module
Java project can generate a series of XML files.

The Cobertura Coverage parser expects to read the coverage data from a
single XML file which contains the coverage data for all modules.
Cobertura has a program with the ability to merge given cobertura.ser files
and then another program to generate a combined XML file from the previous
merged file.  For command line testing, this can be done by hand prior to
|CTest| looking for the coverage files. For script builds,
set the ``|CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND|`` variable to point to a file which will
perform these same steps, such as a .sh or .bat file.

 set(|CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND| .../run-coverage-and-consolidate.sh)

where the ``run-coverage-and-consolidate.sh`` script is perhaps created by
the ``|configure_file|()`` command and might contain the following code:

 #!/usr/bin/env bash
 CoberturaFiles="$(find "/path/to/source" -name "cobertura.ser")"
 SourceDirs="$(find "/path/to/source" -name "java" -type d)"
 cobertura-merge --datafile coberturamerge.ser $CoberturaFiles
 cobertura-report --datafile coberturamerge.ser --destination . \
                  --format xml $SourceDirs

The script uses ``find`` to capture the paths to all of the cobertura.ser files
found below the project's source directory.  It keeps the list of files and
supplies it as an argument to the ``cobertura-merge`` program. The ``--datafile``
argument signifies where the result of the merge will be kept.

The combined ``coberturamerge.ser`` file is then used to generate the XML report
using the ``cobertura-report`` program.  The call to the cobertura-report program
requires some named arguments.

``--datafila``
  path to the merged .ser file

``--destination``
  path to put the output files(s)

``--format``
  file format to write output in: xml or html

The rest of the supplied arguments consist of the full paths to the
/src/main/java directories of each module within the souce tree. These
directories are needed and should not be forgotten.
